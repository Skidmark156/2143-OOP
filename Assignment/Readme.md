This is Grabiel Gacovicaj giving his presentation over Leveraging Retrieval Augmented Generationn to Improve Access to University Information. It was really interesting and cool. It was about generative AI, a type of AI that can understand and give human-like respones. He showed us his own chat bot that he main called mustang.io. It gave him respones based on what he typed into the chat bar.

I also stayed after his presentation and watched the Leakage and Sucker-Rod Pump. I didn't get a picture of the three guys that were up there but it was really intersting. I didn't understand a lot of what they were talking about but I know that you need lube and they had a better concept of using a straight plunger. Instead, of the ball and hole pump. They also didn't get to use the psi level they use on the field just because of safety reasons.
